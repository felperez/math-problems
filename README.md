# math-problems

The idea of this repo is sharing math problems and solutions, to eventually archive them in code. Eventually a document can be put together, where each solution will be credited to its author. Once solutions to problems are accepted, they can be submitted to the main branch as PRs in tex files so that they can be put into the main document. I will prepare the document as we move forward.

The problems can be posted in the [issues](https://github.com/felperez/math-problems/issues) section of the repo. Github supports inline latex by wrapping the code inside single dollar signs, and multiline text by wrapping the code around two dollar signs.
